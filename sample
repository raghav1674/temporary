ASG:
===
don't add volume as part of the launch templates

1. terminate the instance 
2. a new vm will be created by asg, so as part of the userdata script:
    - find the volume which is available and has tag as asg-name
    - if no volume found (as it can be the first time we are creating cluster):
        - create a new ebs volume with the required size,throughput,iops.
    - attach volume to the current instance 
    - mount that volume with the current instance
    - prepare the volume to be usable by the current instance
    - do any other configuration if required
    - start the es-service
    - tag the volume with asg-name
    - mark the node as healthy in asg

if it fails:
    - mark the instance as unhealthy in asg
    - optionally delete the newly created volume
